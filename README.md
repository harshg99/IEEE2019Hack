# Gamifying education

## Introduction

How do we make learning fun for studens in middle to high school who are distracted by gaming and entertainment sources today? Well all you need is to make learning another game. Inspired by Pokemon Go, students are given tasks or quests to complete in the form of quizzes and assignments. Students can choose to do any tasks in any order but on a given school day they are supposed to complete all the assigned tasks. Teaching would occur in person and students would be given a schedule of classes that would allow them to complete those tasks!
